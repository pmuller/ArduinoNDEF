# Arduino NDEF Library

## Overview

This library provides comprehensive support for handling NFC Data Exchange
Format (NDEF) on Arduino platforms.
It's designed to offer an easy and efficient way to serialize and deserialize
NDEF records and messages,
adhering closely to the NDEF specification.
The library is a work in progress but is approaching a stable release.

## Features
